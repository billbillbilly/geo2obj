# geo2obj

## Introduction
geo2obj is a small project that automates the process of converting LAS/DEM data into 3d file for 3D modelining and analysis of built environment with minimun coding requirement.
This project may be wrapped up in a package in the future.

what it provide:
- get lidar data only with a bbox (bounding box)
- convert lidar data to 3D dtm/dsm with generated texture map
- adjust resolution of the 3D output
- generate 3D output as spatial points and 3D mesh

what it will provide (in the future):
- generate building volume only with a bbox
- integrate building volumes and dtm in the 3D output

## Installation
#### Step 1: install R

#### Step 2: install Rstudio

#### Step 3 (optional but required for Windows): install Rtools

#### Step 2: install Rstudio
